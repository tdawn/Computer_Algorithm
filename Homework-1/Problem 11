Using your favorite computer programming language (but C/C++, Java, Python, C#
recommended), write a program that calculate the following:
A group of zombies walk on a very narrow bridge. The length of the bridge is k meters.
The moving speed of each zombie is one meter per second. When a zombie reaches an end
of the bridge, he leaves the bridge. When two zombies meet, they turn back and walk in
opposite directions.
You are given the original positions of zombies in the bridge, but you donâ€™t know the initial
moving directions of the zombies. You have to compute the earliest time and the latest
time for all zombies to leave the bridge.
Input:
The first line of input, you are given an integer number for the number of zombies (let it
n). The second line gives you the length of the bridge (k in meters). The third (the last)
line has n integers denoting the initial positions of zombies in the bridge.
All the input integers are not bigger than 1,000,000, separated by space.
Output:
You print two numbers, the earliest time and the latest time (in seconds).
Example:
Input
4
10
2 3 6 7
Output
4 8
3
